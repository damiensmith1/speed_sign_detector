## Traffic Sign Detection and Classification

This project focuses on the detection and classification of traffic signs. It utilizes YOLOv5 for object detection and a ResNet18 model for classification. The system is capable of identifying traffic signs in both images and video streams, cropping the detected signs, and classifying them into predefined categories.
